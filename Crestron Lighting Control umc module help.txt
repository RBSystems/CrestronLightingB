Crestron Lighting Control
=========================


General Description:
==================== 

  This umc module provides the ability to interact with and manipulate up to 25 lighting loads for a room.  The loads
  are divided into 5 groups, with 5 loads in each group.  Each load within the group is associated with a position 1-5.
  Only one group at a time is accessible for display. You have the ability to cycle forward and backward through the groups.
  A name can manually be associated to each load.  Depending on how many loads exist within a group, a corresponding
  subpage output signal is driven high. These output signals should be tied to subpages that will respectively display
  either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 sets of load controls (On/Raise/Lower/Off & analog fb) respectively.

  OUTPUT Description
  ------------------
  - Show_PosX-X_Subpage_Fb               (D) Corresponding signal will be driven high depending on how many loads exist in
